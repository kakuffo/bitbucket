CSV Tools does a great job exporting and importing data. Javascript objects can easily be exported to CSV, 
a format that non-programmers can easily understand and modify. On the other hand, CSV data can be imported

### **jq**

jq is like sed for JSON data - you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured 
data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep and friends let you play with text.
jq is written in portable C, and it has zero runtime dependencies. You can download a single binary, 
scp it to a far away machine of the same type, and expect it to work.
